If your potato plants start to exhibit small, irregular dark brown spots on the lowest or oldest leaves, they may be afflicted with early blight of potatoes. The disease is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani, which can also afflict tomatoes and other members of the potato family.
Potatoes become infected with early blight when foliage has become excessively wet due to rain, fog, dew, or irrigation. Although not a terminal disease, severe infections can be fairly detrimental. In contrast to its name, early blight rarely develops early; it actually usually affects mature foliage rather than young, tender leaves.

Symptoms first occur on the lower or oldest leaves of the plant. Dark, brown spots appear on this older foliage and, as the disease progresses, enlarge, taking on an angular shape. These lesions often look like a target and, in fact, the disease is sometimes referred to as target spot.

Treatment of early blight includes prevention by planting potato varieties that are resistant to the disease; late maturing are more resistant than early maturing varieties. Avoid overhead irrigation and allow for sufficient aeration between plants to allow the foliage to dry as quickly as possible. Practice a 2-year crop rotation. That is, do not replant potatoes or other crops in this family for 2 years after a potato crop has been harvested. Keep the potato plants healthy and stress free by providing adequate nutrition and sufficient irrigation, especially later in the growing season after flowering when plants are most susceptible to the disease. Remove plant debris and weed hosts at the end of the season to mitigate areas where the disease may overwinter.
